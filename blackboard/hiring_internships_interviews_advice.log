== Interview types ==

In-person white board coding interview, used at Google and Bloomberg. Practice is helpful. For example, program in vi no autocomplete and mentally debug the code. Try problems from project euler. 

Phone coding interviews which are done using shared Google docs.

Verbal only: you talk about a project you've worked on, what was interesting, hard and what were you proud of.

People looking for internships should start in August, as that’s when many companies start their process. Companies that start in August usually are 80-90% done on hiring interns by the time Spring semester starts. Some companies start in the Spring. 

== visas ==

Needing a visa makes the hiring process harder. Usually big companies are more willing to go through the trouble of doing a visa hire for an internship. Having a visa is another reason to start earlier since its an extra wrinkle and many companies won’t both to go through the hassle. 

Visa holders should be up front about needing a visa at the onset in discussions with recruiters. In many cases HR can’t or won't  questions about visa. If the student brings up the topic, then HR is allowed to talk about the visa and then HR can quickly sort out if the company can or cannot consider hiring the student.
