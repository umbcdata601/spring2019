<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>I apologize for creating confusion regarding the due date for project 1. The date on the syllabus and the date in my lecture slides was inconsistent, so when this was pointed out to me I selected the later date. Although the date of March 6 was set, I neglected to synchronize that update with Blackboard's due date for submitting the notebook for project 1. </p>
<p>I have now synchronized the syllabus date (March 6 presentation) with the lecture slides (also stating March 6) with the notebook submission due date in Blackboard (notebooks due March 7). The presentation of the notebook is made in class on March 6. The notebooks are to be submitted to Blackboard after the presentation.</p>
<p>Again, I apologize for causing stress.</p>
<p>If you have questions, please email me.</p>
<p>Ben</p>
