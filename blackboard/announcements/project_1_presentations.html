<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>For Wednesday's class, please be prepared to give your presentation. You can use my laptop or your laptop. If you are using your laptop, the display connections in the classroom are VGA and HDMI. If you are using my laptop, please send me your notebook before class so I can download and open it prior to class.</p>
<p><em>Offer</em>: if you would like your presentation recorded, I can use either my phone or your phone. My offer to record video is intended to help you review your presentation skills and will not be used for grading of the project.</p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
