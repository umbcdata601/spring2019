<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>In my announcement for the final project I indicated there was a rubric for the proposal posted in Blackboard. However, I neglected to post a rubric for the proposal. I've corrected my mistake. The rubric for the proposal contains the same content as the announcement, so if you've already posted your proposal to Blackboard I don't foresee any concerns.</p>
<p>I also posted the rubric for the final project on Blackboard. There are points associated with the notebook submission and points for a presentation. Because of the limited time available during the final exam, we will be holding an in-class lottery to determine who presents during the final exam on May 22. The lottery will be held during the final exam, so you will need to be present and prepared in case you are selected to present.</p>
<p>If you are selected to present May 22, then your final project grade will be the sum of points associated with your notebook and your presentation. If you do not present on May 22, then your final project grade is based entirely on the notebook you submitted.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have questions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
