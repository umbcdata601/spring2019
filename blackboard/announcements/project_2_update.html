<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I've graded the project 2 proposals which were submitted on Blackboard. If I gave feedback to proceed, then you should proceed with analysis of the data set.</p>
<p>A few submissions had Kaggle as a proposed data source. In the previous announcement on Project 2, I said to not use a data source for which existing analysis can be found. This same guidance will apply to the final project.</p>
<p>Once your project 2 notebook is submitted to Blackboard, I will be grading the submission. Then I will be posting your notebook to github.com. Please let me know in the comment field in Blackboard whether you want your name included in the file on the Internet.</p>
<p>I previously sent out an anonymous survey on whether students are comfortable having content posted on the Internet. Please let me know if you have concerns.</p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
