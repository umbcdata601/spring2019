<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>After class last night I helped a student brainstorm ideas for analysis in their final project. I am available to help you do the same.</p>
<p>One of the questions raised in our brainstorming session was how to apply normalization to their dataset. The student was joining (events with timestamps) and (precipitation per day). To get the two variables on the same time scale, we considered events per day and precipitation per day. Plotting these two variables on a scatter plot would be a potentially useful visualization. No normalization required for the scatter plot since the inputs aren't categorical variables.</p>
<p>The presence of normalization in the rubric is not intended to indicate a submitted project must have an example of normalization. The requirement only applies to projects where comparison of categorical variables is being made.</p>
<p>Another candidate visualization would be to compare total number of events on days with precipitation against total number of events on days without precipitation. Plotted on a bar chart as two bars, this comparison would benefit from normalization. Suppose there were 2 days out of a month that had precipitation and the other 28 days did not. Because of the imbalance of days, comparing the total number of events in each category is not useful. To normalize the comparison, plot a bar chart showing (total number of events on days with precipitation divided by the number of days with precipitation) and (total number of events on days without precipitation divided by the number of days without precipitation).</p>
