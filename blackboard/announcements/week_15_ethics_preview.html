<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>On Wednesday (our last regular class before the final presentations on <a href="https://umbc.app.box.com/s/ugfkzm0h26d7rijxn3e0aw7nkjsn5wpb">May 22</a>) we will be discussing cost-benefit analysis since we didn't get to that last week. The second topic will be ethics in data science.</p>
<p>*********************************</p>
<p>In order to get you thinking about ethical implications of Data Science, I have two suggested resources.​</p>
<p>The first is a podcast on bias in Machine Learning. The episode is 1 hour long. https://youarenotsosmart.com/2017/11/20/yanss-115-how-we-transferred-our-biases-into-our-machines-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/​</p>
<p>Second, read "Data science algorithms" (PDF posted in Blackboard &gt; Course materials), specifically section 1.62 on pages 32-37. This section is on privacy and big data.​</p>
<p>If you have other topics you think would be of interest to the class regarding ethics and moral concepts in Data Science, please let me know.​</p>
<p>*********************************</p>
<p>The Student Course Evaluation (SCE) is now available online. SCE is anonymous and completely confidential. As the instructor, I can see only the participation count for the survey.</p>
<p>You should have received email notices from StudentCourseEvaluations@umbc.edu with a link to the surveys. In addition, you can access the survey via Blackboard and myUMBC.</p>
<p>UMBC wants me to tell you this:<br /> "The Student Evaluation of Educational Quality (SEEQ) is a standardized course evaluation instrument used to provide measures of an instructor’s teaching effectiveness. The results of this questionnaire will be used by promotion and tenure committees as part of the instructor’s evaluation. The Direct Instructor Feedback Forms (DIFFs) were designed to provide feedback to instructors and they are not intended for use by promotion and tenure committees. The responses to the SEEQ and the DIFFs will be kept confidential and will not be distributed until final grades are in."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
