<p>Good evening!</p>
<p>In this email there are four distinct topics.</p>
<p>1: assumptions **************************************</p>
<p>Please bring the list of assumptions that you created in the first week. We will be reviewing these in class.</p>
<p>2: graphs **************************************</p>
<p>As a preview of the content that will be presented on Wednesday during lecture, we'll be describing graphs. ​</p>
<p>I won't go into great detail in class on application of graphs, as there are many. For example, this page gives a great overview on Social network analysis: <a href="http://www.orgnet.com/sna.html">http://www.orgnet.com/sna.html</a> ​ <br />This is a 4 part series, but each part is short: <a href="https://tdwi.org/articles/2016/07/25/graph-databases-for-analytics-1.aspx">https://tdwi.org/articles/2016/07/25/graph-databases-for-analytics-1.aspx</a>​ ​</p>
<p>I will describe graphs in detail, including when to use them rather than alternative data structures. I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkX">networkx</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz">graphviz</a> for demos.​</p>
<p>I provide an introduction to property graphs. Property graphs are like normal graphs with attributes added. I will demonstrate property graphs using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo4j">Neo4j</a>. ​</p>
<p>3: proposal **************************************</p>
<p>Final project proposals will be due in Blackboard on April 24. More details will be provided in a separate announcement.</p>
<p>4: checksums **************************************</p>
<p>Lastly, a tip on ensuring a file hasn't changed since this check was previous performed.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum​">checksum</a> is the concept that the contents of a file can be validated to not have changed.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#MD5_hashes​">MD5 sums</a> for files that I want to confirm are unaltered. ​</p>
<pre>import hashlib<BR>
md5 = lambda x: hashlib.md5(open(x, ‘rb’).read()).hexdigest()
</pre>

<p>here are three different online examples of the code:</p>
