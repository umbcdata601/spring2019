<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>To preview the class on Wednesday, we will be reviewing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">math</a>. Covering hundreds of years of progress in a complex domain will necessarily be superficial, so the goal is to expose you to terms and concepts relevant to your role as a data scientist.</p>
<p>We will spend time exploring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability">probability</a> in a hands-on exercise and do some in-class coding. We will also discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy">numpy</a>, a library for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra">linear algebra</a>. Experience in calculus and differential equations is not necessary, but being able to know when to apply which concept is helpful as a data scientist.</p>
<p>Project 2 is coming up, so I will be sending an email on this topic before class with some details.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask me questions via email prior to class, or to set up an in-person meeting outside of class.</p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
