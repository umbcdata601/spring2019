<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I've graded the project 2 notebooks that were submitted in Blackboard. <br />If you have not yet submitted your project notebook, please do so before coming to class.</p>
<p>We will not be making presentations for project 2. We will be reviewing and writing code in class.</p>
<p>If you don't have a laptop to bring to class this evening, please let me know.</p>
<p>******* bonus for reading to the end of the email; no action needed ********* <br />To illustrate cool visualizations that can be done in data science, see this picture: https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/09/Population-cartogram_World-2.png</p>
<p>There's a long description of the data here: https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-cartogram</p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
