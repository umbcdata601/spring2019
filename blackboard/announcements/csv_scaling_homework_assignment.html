<p>Good morning,</p>

<p>For the CSV scaling assignment, please ignore the rubric's runtime constraint for notebook submissions. I will be inspecting your <span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">results in the </span>notebook; I do not want to execute each submitted notebook.</p>

<p>A few students asked me similar questions about the homework assignment on scaling CSVs, so I'm sharing my response in case other folks have related confusion. I've also added these clarifications in the assignment on Blackboard.</p>
<p>My intention was that there should be three different files per file size.</p>
<p>The precision of the file sizes is +/- 20%.</p>
<p>A few assignments have already been submitted, so I won't remove points for violating the above guidance.</p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
