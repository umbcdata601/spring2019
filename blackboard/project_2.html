<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>Project 2 is an analysis of a data set to answer one or more questions about the data. In this email I provide the timeline and context.</p>
<ul>
<li>March 25: project 2 proposals are due via Blackboard. Submit your proposal in plain text. Do not include your name in the proposal. The proposal should explain the intent of the analysis. The proposal is graded. The rubric for the proposal is posted to Blackboard.</li>
<li>April 9: project 2 notebooks are due via Blackboard. Submit your notebook and explain in the notebook where to get the data. I will upload your project 2 notebook to http://github.com</li>
<li>April 10: in class you will attempt to reproduce the results from other submitted projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not comfortable having your notebook for project 2 uploaded to a publicly accessible website, please let me via email.</p>
<p>For projects in Data 601 you pick the data source for your project​ from a list I provide (see <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Blackboard &gt; Course Materials &gt; list of data sources</span>), or you provide a data source in your proposal.​ Do not use any of the data sources used in projects 1 (see <span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Blackboard &gt; Course announcements &gt; data sources used for project 1</span>). Data discovery is outside the scope of this class, but you're not restricted to picking from the list I provide. You should pick a data source you have some background knowledge in​. Do not use a data source for which existing analysis can be found. Data should be tabular and have at least 10 columns and at least 1000 rows. Data should not exceed 100MB in size. No preprocessing of data should be done outside of your Jupyter notebook. Data should be text (not images or audio or video).</p>
<p>I changed project 2 from what was listed in the syllabus. I have updated the syllabus in Blackboard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What I care about for the project​:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: determine relevant scope appropriate to your skills while still pushing your experience​</li>
<li>Reproducibility: A description of research methods can be called "coherent" and "complete" when readers understand the process well enough to replicate it themselves.</li>
<li>Analysis​ should
<ul>
<li>apply methods learned in class​</li>
<li>Use Python 3 in a Jupyter notebook​. Do not present results in Powerpoint or PDF or Keynote.</li>
<li>Demonstrates process of data science, from gathering data to telling story through characterization ​and analysis</li>
<li>Use a visualization for the data that presents the relevant story</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>​</p>
<p>The proposal is an opportunity for you and me to negotiate what the data source for the project is. Below is an example of a proposal that would be submitted via Blackboard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The source URL for the data is http://pinkmonkeys.edu/a_file.csv. There is no cost to accessing this data. [Does access require creation of an account?]​</p>
<p>Accessing this data does not violate any laws. This data does not appear to have been previously analyzed based on a Google search. ​</p>
<p>A preliminary survey of the data indicates there are 10,000 rows, 20 columns, and the file is 500 kB. ​</p>
</blockquote>
