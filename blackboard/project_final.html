<p>The Data 601 Final Project is an analysis of two (or more) data sets to answer one or more questions about the combined data. (The questions shouldn't be answerable using a single source.) In this email I provide the timeline and context.</p>
<ul>
<li>April 24: final project proposals are due via Blackboard. Submit your proposal in plain text. Do not include your name in the proposal. The proposal should explain the intent of the analysis. The proposal is graded. The rubric for the proposal is posted to Blackboard. </li>
<li>May 20: final project notebooks are due via Blackboard. Submit your .ipynb notebook and explain in the notebook where to get the data. I will upload your notebook to http://github.com</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not comfortable having your notebook uploaded to a publicly accessible website, please let me via the comment field in Blackboard when submitting your notebook.</p>
<p>For projects in Data 601 you pick the data sources for your project​ from a list I provide (see Blackboard &gt; Course Materials &gt; list of data sources), or you provide a data source in your proposal.​ Do not use any of the data sources used in projects 1 or project 2 (see Blackboard &gt; Course announcements &gt; data sources used for project 1 and 2). Data discovery is outside the scope of this class, but you're not restricted to picking from the list I provide. You should pick a data source you have some background knowledge in​. Do not use a data source for which existing analysis can be found. No preprocessing of data should be done outside of your Jupyter<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"> notebook. Data should be text (not images or audio or video).</span></p>
<p>Combined data should be tabular and have at least 10 columns and at least 500 rows. Data should not exceed 100MB in size.  If exceptions to the dimensions or file size are needed, please email me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What I care about for the project​:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge: determine relevant scope appropriate to your skills while still pushing your experience​</li>
<li>Reproducibility: A description of research methods can be called "coherent" and "complete" when readers understand the process well enough to replicate it themselves.</li>
<li>Analysis​ should
<ul>
<li>apply methods learned in class​</li>
<li>Use Python 3 in a Jupyter notebook​. Do not present results in Powerpoint or PDF or Keynote.</li>
<li>Demonstrates process of data science, from gathering data to telling story through characterization ​and analysis</li>
<li>Use a visualization for the data that presents the relevant story</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>To illustrate potential ideas for combining distinct data sources, consider</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch/search?query=weather">weather</a> and <a href="https://www.gharchive.org/">number of commits made to github</a> -- is more software written when weather is not favorable to being outdoors?</li>
<li>weather and agricultural yield for a specific region -- what weather conditions correlate with good harvests?</li>
<li>weather and energy usage -- how does home energy use correlate with grid load?</li>
<li>high school graduation rates and income -- how does financial prosperity impact student success?</li>
<li>Fresh water available per country versus population; then compare your analysis to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_renewable_water_resources</li>
</ul>
<p>​If you would like help brainstorming ideas, let me know via email to benpayne@umbc.edu.</p>

<p>The proposal is an opportunity for you and me to negotiate what the data sources for the project are. Below is an example of a proposal that would be submitted via Blackboard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The source URLs for the data is http://pinkmonkeys.edu/a_file.csv and http://bluewhale.edu/some_data.json. These two data sources can be merged based on the product ID which is common to both files. There is no cost to accessing this data. [Does access require creation of an account?]​</p>
<p>Accessing this data does not violate any laws. This data does not appear to have been previously analyzed based on a Google search. ​</p>
<p>A preliminary survey of the data in <span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">a_file.</span>csv indicates there are 10,000 rows, 20 columns, and the file is 500 kB. ​The <span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">some_data.</span>json has 400 entries and is 1MB.</p>
