<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>In class this week we will be experimenting with in-class activities focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility">reproducibility</a>. Coming to a conclusion regarding data analysis may be useful, but if the results cannot be arrived at by anyone else, then a problem exists. This situation is <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">unfortunately common</a>.</p>
<p>"Repeatability measures the variation in measurements taken by a single instrument or person under the same conditions, while reproducibility measures whether an entire study or experiment can be reproduced in its entirety." [<a href="https://www.labmate-online.com/news/news-and-views/5/breaking-news/what-is-the-difference-between-repeatability-and-reproducibility/30638">source</a>]. This class will fall between reproducibility and replicability, whereÂ <span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">replicability is</span> "the ability of another person to produce the same results using the same tools and the same data." [<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/data-sciences-reproducibility-crisis-b87792d88513">source</a>] For additional resources, see these <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/reproducibility-guide/blob/gh-pages/sections/references/index.md">references for reproducibility</a>.</p>
<p>For project 2, you spent a lot of time to arrive at the results of your data analysis. Because class is limited to 2.5 hours, we won't have as much time to reach the same outcome. To facilitate quicker analysis in class we will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a>. Pair programming is rarely practiced in data science due to the scarcity of data scientists.</p>
<p>In order to gain familiarity with pair programming, please review the guidance on <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/">this page</a> and <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html">here</a> and <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-benefits-and-pitfalls-of-pair-programming-in-the-workplace-e68c3ed3c81f">this article</a>. <strong>We will have an short in-class quiz</strong> to measure how well everyone understands pair programming concepts.</p>
<p><strong>I will be posting your notebooks for project 2 online</strong> prior to Wednesday. Please let me know if you have concerns about this.</p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
