<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>This week we will be discussing analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series">time series data</a>. Data that is indexed by a timestamp is extremely prevalent.</p>
<p>Techniques used frequently for analysis include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform​">Fourier transform</a> and linear regression (see chapter 3 in​ <a href="https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf">An introduction to Statistical Learning</a>). Additional (optional) reading is available on the <a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-discovery-of-statistical-regression/">history of regression and least squares</a>.</p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
