<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>Below I respond to questions that were asked in class.</p>
<p><em>How do you know when to use a Python library? And how to know which Python library to use?</em><br /> I start by planning my attack on a challenge. Break the task into steps, then consider whether any other programmer might have faced a similar task. If yes, then search for a library that has that functionality. I may find multiple options available. Then I read the summary of each library. If that doesn't provide sufficient distinction, I then evaluate each candidate. If this sounds like it takes a lot of time and is inefficient, then you understand why solving programming challenges takes time. The good news is that you get faster and more efficient as you are exposed to additional challenges. Each challenge may be unique, but often the tasks required to address one challenge are similar to previous tasks you've solved. Therefore, experience enables efficiency. Experience comes from exposure to a variety of challenges.</p>
<p><em>How would you set up a production process in Python? For example, a program that runs once per week and needs to be run by any one of several people on a team. Would a Jupyter notebook be appropriate?</em><br /> There are a few components in this question, so I will tackle them separately.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is appropriate for a team depends strongly on the skills of each team member. If everyone on a team is comfortable running a tool, then any member can use that tool. If a team member is not familiar with the two, then either they would need to learn that tool or the number of people supporting the effort is effectively reduced. This is an example of a social-technical problem of finding a tool all members can use or figuring out whether people are willing to learn something new.</li>
<li>Jupyter notebooks are used in production (not just research and prototyping: <a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/using-notebooks-as-the-unifying-layer-for-data-roles-at-netflix-with-matthew-seal-episode-54/">listen</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/scheduling-notebooks-348e6c14cfd6">read</a>), though that may not be appropriate. In a production process, having consistency and being able to reconstruct an event are important. The fact that Jupyter notebooks are intended for dynamic editing at runtime conflicts with the objectives of consistency and reproducibility.</li>
<li>A challenge for scheduled tasks is that they require having a reliable host (human or machine) that can trigger the event. Running a scheduled task automatically (Windows task scheduler, "cron" in linux) alleviates the need for team members to become involved but introduces the need for a computer that is available to host the scheduled task.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Is everything in Python processed in memory?</em><br /> By default, yes. There are ways to process data on disk. One example is use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format">HDF5</a>. There is Python support for performing operations with HDF5 on disk when the data is too big to be loaded into memory.</p>
<p><em>What other classes does Ben teach?</em><br /> No other classes at UMBC: just Data 601. If you're seeking guidance on other classes or instructors, feel free to ask.</p>
