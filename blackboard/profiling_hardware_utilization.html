<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>The one question I got in class last week was how to measure and record computational resources programmatically.</p>
<p>I supplied a notebook in "Blackboard &gt; Course Materials &gt; Week 9 &gt; notebooks". In the .zip file, see the folder "host_streaming_stats" which contains a notebook to record the activities of another notebook using Python.</p>
<p>That notebook goes beyond the standard cell and line profiling discussed last week by measuring resource utilization during execution (e.g., CPU, RAM, disk, network).</p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
