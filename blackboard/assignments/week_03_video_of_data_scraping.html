Summary of the video content:

The goal of the narrator is to find the Mario Maker level with the most plays and the most star ratings. 

The problem solved in the video is collecting the data. Nintendo does not offer it in a giant spreadsheet. You can pull up a query that shows 100 or whatever at a time, but we need 10^6 rows to achieve the goal.

At around 4:35 or so he breaks down the query, explains how someone wrote a script to scrape the website (a polite script too, which is smart - it didn't overwhelm the servers or cause the IP address to get blocked) and then briefly explains some of the other neat things you can find within the data set before diving in to address the goal.
