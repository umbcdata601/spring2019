Proposal for project is the same weight as a homework assignment.





Not submitting plain text: -10%. 

Not submitting via Blackboard: -10%. 

If documented EDA is found to be available for the data: -10%.   

Submit late: -10% per week. 

Not submitting a proposal for the project at least 1 week prior to the project due date: the proposal will get a zero.  

Not including the data source in the proposal means the proposal is considered invalid and will get a zero for the submitted proposal.  
The lowest possible score is 0 for a proposal.  Even with lowered scores, a proposal is still required for a project to proceed.  

Submitting a project that uses a data source different from what was registered in the proposal gets a zero grade.
