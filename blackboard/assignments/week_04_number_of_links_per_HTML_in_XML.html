I provide you with a compressed XML file. Some of the fields contain HTML. 

Extract the XML from the .zip file. In Python, use a module to parse the XML (do not write an XML parser).

In Python, extract the HTML from the XML. Then use BeautifulSoup4 to parse the HTML. 

For each HTML page, report the number of links (URLs with the tag < a href="URL">text) in each HTML page.

Submit a single Jupyter notebook that parses the XML file and produces the count of links per HTML file.



Advanced students: if you complete the assignment above and are are seeking a challenge, use an alternative method (i.e., regular expressions or Python's find) to validate the count of HTML links per page reported by BeautifulSoup4.
