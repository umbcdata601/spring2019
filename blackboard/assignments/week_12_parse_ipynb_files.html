<p>Submit a notebook that finds all other notebooks used for Data 601 on your computer and generates a list of the modules used​.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for .ipynb files using the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">glob</span> module in Python</li>
<li>Your analysis should include at least five .ipynb files. </li>
<li>Files used for code other than assignments (eg projects, work from other courses) is acceptable to include</li>
<li>Create functions that parse the file and find modules.</li>
<li>Use a loop to call the functions on each file.</li>
<li>Look for code cells (ignore Markdown and raw cells)</li>
<li>Look for lines of code that start with either "from" or "import"​</li>
<li>Look for the keywords only in code input (rather than including cell output content)</li>
</ul>
<p>Result is a list of unique modules used. The list doesn't need to include specific functions. For example, in </p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">from math import pi</span></p>
<p>The relevant module is <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">math</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Submit your python notebook as an .ipynb file containing the code for the implementation and the results.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Optional bonus question</em>: How many lines of Python code have you created for Data 601? ​</p>
