<p>For projects in Data 601 you pick the data source for your project​ from a list I provide (see Blackboard &gt; Course Materials &gt; list of data sources), or you provide a data source in your proposal.​ Data discovery is outside the scope of this class, but you're not restricted to picking from the list I provide. You should pick a data source you have some background knowledge in​. Do not use a data source for which existing analysis can be found. Data should be tabular and have at least 5 columns and at least 100 rows. Data should not exceed 100MB in size. Data should be in a single file. No preprocessing of data should be done outside of your Jupyter notebook. Data should be text (not images or audio or video). </p>
<p></p>
<p>The proposal is an opportunity for you and me to negotiate what the data source for the project is. Below is an example of a proposal that would be submitted via Blackboard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The source URL for the data is <a href="http://pinkmonkeys.edu/a_file.csv." target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://pinkmonkeys.edu/a_file.csv.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1549826421326000&amp;usg=AFQjCNExo-tYVsrkqD1IXxkuFFkInWb7GQ" style="color: #1155cc;">http://pinkmonkeys.edu/a_file.<wbr />csv.</a> There is no cost to accessing this data. [Does access require creation of an account?]​</p>
<p>Accessing this data does not violate any laws. This data does not appear to have been previously analyzed based on a Google search. ​</p>
<p>A preliminary survey of the data indicates there are 10,000 rows, 20 columns, and the file is 500 kB. ​</p>
