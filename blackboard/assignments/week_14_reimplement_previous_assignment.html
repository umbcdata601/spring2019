<p>For an assignment you previously submitted, reimplement the solution with a faster approach. ​If the original code does not satisfy the assignment, implement a correct solution prior to optimizing the code.</p>
<p>Measure the change of timing for the original and revised notebooks​. The amount of change is not important; merely that measurable improvement exists in the revision</p>
<p></p>
<p>Options for improving performance (suggestions; not required):​</p>
<ul>
<li>Rewrite the code to perform the same outcome more efficiently</li>
<li>Use numba​</li>
<li>Use multiprocessing​</li>
<li>Use dask​</li>
<li>Replace a function call with lambda​</li>
<li>Replace a for loop with a list comprehension​</li>
<li>Use a RAM disk​</li>
<li>Make fewer external function calls (eg faker, random)​</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>If you are unable to find optimizations, email me three of your original notebooks with timing added by Sunday evening; I will help you find opportunities​.</p>
<p>In the original notebook and the revised notebook, print the time for execution of each cell<br /> The change should only modify code in a single cell<br /> Use a markdown cell immediately above the code revision to point out to the reader that the code cell was modified<br /> In a markdown cell at the top of the revised notebook, explain what the change made in the code is<br /> In a markdown cell at the top of the revised notebook, specify the original timing and new timing for the cell that was changed.</p>
<p>Submit the original notebook (with timings present in the notebook) and the revised notebook (with timings present in the notebook)​ ​</p>
