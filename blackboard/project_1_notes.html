<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>Most of you should have received feedback notes from your fellow students. The four columns for the assessment were</p>
<ul>
<li>I could hear every word</li>
<li>I could understand every word</li>
<li>presenter's confidence</li>
<li>presenter's enthusiasm</li>
</ul>
<p>For those of you curious about the distribution of durations, I made a histogram:<br /> https://imgur.com/a/WXbkOUO</p>
<p>Please submit your project 1 notebooks by the deadline set in Blackboard. </p>
<p>Let me know if you have questions or feedback. </p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
