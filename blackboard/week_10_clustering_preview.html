<p>Good evening,​</p>
<p>This week we will discuss clustering of numerical data and clustering of text files. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">Clustering</a> is relevant when you have big data – more than can be reviewed manually. ​ ​</p>
<p>At the beginning of class there will be a short survey.</p>
